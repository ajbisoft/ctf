## Google Dorks

By crafting specific search queries, known as Google Dorks, you can find information that wasnâ€™t meant to be public. These queries can pull up everything from exposed administrative directories to logs containing passwords and indices of sensitive directories. For example:

- To find administrative panels: `site:example.com inurl:admin`
- To unearth log files with passwords: `filetype:log "password" site:example.com`
- To discover backup directories: `intitle:"index of" "backup" site:example.com`
